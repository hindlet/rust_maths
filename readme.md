# Rust Maths

- This is my crate of rust maths that I use for my projects
- You can use it if you want but features are only added when I need them or want to, also the documentation is patchy at best


## Features
- Quicksort lists of items with another variable
- 3d Vector and Matrix Maths
- Collider and raycast maths
- Normal Distribution probability density and cumulative distibution
- Simplex Noise (currently 2d, 3d and 4d to come)
- Imports of rand_chacha for seeded rng
